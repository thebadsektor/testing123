20051,Lacey Howard,"Lacey's performance has been sub standard in the past 3 months. She tries to take up too many tasks at the same time without realizing that she is yet to master the art of multitasking. Although she has delivered some results, they are much less than what her peers are able to achieve, given the exact same situation. Unless she improves a lot by taking advantage of a collaborative team, she may not be able to add any value to the business or worse, to herself."
20057,Amy Jones,"Amy struggles at her work a lot. Shes always off task and late for work. If she could overcome that, she may have a chance of making a better career.  But overall she needs a lot of work"
20058,Amy Jones,Amy Jones is a nice person and she is dedicated in her work but she is more of a hard worker. She is one of the inconsistent with her work. She lack some potential that leads to some low performance. She needs to concentrate more in the work to achieve great things.
20059,Amy Jones,Amy Jones needs to become a better player. She goes threw a lot of up and downs. Her performance needs some work. It seems that she may have reached her full growth as a player.
20060,Amy Jones,"Amy is able to focus on the task at hand only in short bursts of time. This continuous partial attention without long time focus is taking a huge toll on her output affecting delivery timelines. She should focus on speed and accuracy but balance both. With her, it's either fast output with lots of errors or defect free output that is delivered late by a day or two."
20085,Rylan Mack,Rylan Mack is a danger to his position. He has shown recklessness and apathy in his ability to complete tasks. He does not work well in a team setting. Mr. Mack shows no motivation and I suggest he be moved out of our department.
20087,Rylan Mack,"Rylan's miserable run continues this quarter as well. He has not been able to achieve a single target. In fact, he had done the opposite by losing some key customer accounts due to improper response. I am afraid we need to take a hard stance on Rylan's future with this organization. Unless of course, he realizes his work ethics or lack a lack thereof and does something about it on an urgent basis."
20088,Rylan Mack,"Ryan Mack is the worst. No one here is going to tell you a single thing good that he can do. The simplest of tasks leave him confused and needing help, that is to say if he even shows up for work. The time and money invested in him could be better used elsewhere."
20099,Blake Booth,"For the past quarter, Blake has had tremendous opportunities to showcase his abilities and prove his worth to the management, but sadly, he has let the opportunity go begging. He failed in the most basic customer satisfaction surveys which shows that his customers are not at all happy with the service he is providing. Although, he has managed to retain some customers, he has not been able to add any new customers to his portfolio. He should really improve his consistency in his results to be considered for better benefits and roles."
20100,Blake Booth,"Blake Booth is a haphazard worker. He does not show a excitement for his tasks. He often shows signs of laziness and underperforms regularly. He does, however, show some signs of possible improvement for the future."
